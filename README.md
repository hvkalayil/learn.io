# learn.io

A Deno based project that is a collaborative platform for people to share and
learn

## Architechture

This is a monorepo containing both the frontend and backend(apps/api) Since both
frontend and backend utilizes deno it makes sense to try a monorepo approach

## Development
After cloning make sure to setup the project `deno task setup`

You can start the backend using `deno task dev:api`
